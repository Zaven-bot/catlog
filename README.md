# üêæ CatLog ‚Äì Your Anime Companion with a Virtual Cat Twist

CatLog is a full-stack web application that combines anime tracking, personalized recommendations, and a virtual cat companion that reacts to your viewing habits. Built with modern technologies and a playful spirit, CatLog is designed to be both personally useful and technically impressive.

## üéØ Purpose

CatLog solves two problems at once:
- **Anime Discovery**: Helps users track what they‚Äôve watched, discover new shows, and visualize their viewing habits.
- **Emotional Engagement**: Adds a virtual cat that responds to user activity‚Äîmaking the experience more fun, rewarding, and memorable.

This project was built as a personal portfolio piece to showcase full-stack development skills while creating something delightful and meaningful.
